I'll help you create user stories for both user types ("developers" and "users") for this network testing framework. I'll structure them using the standard format: "As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

**Developer User Stories:**

1. "As a test developer, I want to create customizable Argo workflows using familiar technologies (Python, Bash, Kubernetes) so that I can design comprehensive test scenarios without learning entirely new tools."

2. "As a test developer, I want to leverage existing Kubernetes infrastructure and tools so that I can focus on test logic rather than infrastructure setup."

3. "As a test developer, I want to define standardized metrics collection (like using Prometheus Pushgateway) so that test results can be consistently stored and analyzed."

4. "As a test developer, I want to create modular and reusable test components so that other developers can build upon existing test patterns."

5. "As a test developer, I want to implement parameterized tests (like bandwidth variations in iperf3) so that users can easily customize test scenarios without modifying code."

**User (Tester) User Stories:**

1. "As a tester, I want to trigger pre-defined test workflows with minimal configuration so that I can quickly execute technology certification tests."

2. "As a tester, I want to view real-time test progress in the Argo UI so that I can monitor test execution and identify issues early."

3. "As a tester, I want to analyze test results through Grafana dashboards so that I can quickly understand performance patterns and identify anomalies."

4. "As a tester, I want to compare test results across different runs so that I can validate technology improvements or regressions."

5. "As a tester, I want to export test results and generate reports so that I can share findings with stakeholders and document certification results."

**Framework Value Proposition Stories:**

1. "As an organization, we want to standardize our testing process so that we can ensure consistent quality across different technology evaluations."

2. "As an organization, we want to automate test execution and analysis so that we can reduce the time and effort required for technology certification."

3. "As an organization, we want to maintain a repository of reusable tests so that we can accelerate future technology evaluations."

4. "As an organization, we want to separate test development from test execution so that we can optimize resource utilization between technical and business teams."

**Implementation Examples from Your Code:**

Your iperf3 test implementation already demonstrates several of these stories:
- Parameterized testing (bandwidth levels: 10M, 50M, 100M)
- Metrics collection to Prometheus
- Kubernetes-native deployment
- Reusable components (workflow templates)
- Clear separation between test definition (developers) and execution (users)

To further enhance the framework based on these user stories, you might consider:

1. Adding more documentation and examples for developers
2. Creating default Grafana dashboards for common test scenarios
3. Implementing a simple API or web interface for test triggering
4. Adding test result summarization and reporting capabilities
5. Creating a template repository for common test patterns

These user stories emphasize the framework's value in bridging the gap between technical test development and business-focused test execution, while maintaining flexibility and ease of use for both user types.
